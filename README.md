# AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals Exam Preparation

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises to help prepare for the AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals Exam. The notebooks cover various Azure AI services, including language and vision services.

## Contents

- `Language.ipynb`: Demonstrates the use of Azure Cognitive Services for language-related tasks such as language detection, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text.
- `VisionComputr.ipynb`: Showcases the use of Azure Cognitive Services for vision-related tasks, including image analysis and object detection using the Azure Vision API.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks, you will need to have access to Azure Cognitive Services. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Create Azure Cognitive Services Resources**: You will need to create resources for the services you intend to use (e.g., Text Analytics, Speech, Computer Vision) in the Azure Portal.

2. **Gather Your Subscription Keys and Endpoints**: After creating the resources, note down the subscription keys and endpoints. You will need to replace placeholders in the notebooks with your actual subscription keys and endpoints.

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

    ```sh
    pip install requests matplotlib Pillow
    ```

4. **Open the Notebooks**: Open the Jupyter notebooks in this repository and follow the instructions within each notebook.
